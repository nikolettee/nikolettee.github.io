For the main page of Homework 2
Create a web page using HTML5 with the heading Homework 2 - Basic Operations.
Besides the heading, this page should contain:
Hyperlink to Part 1 with a brief description of what you will present in this part
Hyperlink to Part 2 with a brief description of what you will present in this part
Hyperlink to Extra Credit (if you will do the extra credit)
Hyperlink to go back to the Homework 1 web page (the main page you created for this course)
Think about user experience and user interface!!! Some tips:
For each page that exhibits a part of HW2, there should be a way to go to other parts of HW2 or to the home page of HW2 - the user should not need to use the back button of the browser
Do not make the user end up with many tabs/windows opened in the browser - open the pages of your site in the same tab/window and only use another tab/window if you are opening another website or web page that is not yours.
Think about what the user will be required to type and do not allow the user to type anything that would offer a "weird" final result such as NaN.

For Part 1:
Create a webpage that contains a script (meaning it should be using JavaScript to present the result) tho display the following:
the letters xy in strong (bold) font, with font family Times New Roman, and the color red
the numbers 12 that should be written in blue color, and font family Arial
the numbers 89 that should be written in green color, emphasized (in italics), and font family Impact
Each of these pairs should be separated by one blank space.
Your output should look like this:       xy 12 89
Remember to include a hyperlink to go back to the Homework 2 main web page 
 

For Part 2:
Create a webpage with a form that will have:
three input boxes for the user to type three integers (numbers)
a button to process the data (numbers) typed by the user
a button to clear the form
a textarea to display the results of the process (or it can be a div or paragraph element)
You will write the JavaScript code that will:
receive the data from those three input boxes for the three integers after the user click on the button to process the data
you will calculate the sum, the average, and the product of the three integers
you will also calculate the smallest and the largest of the three integers typed
TIP: For finding the smallest and largest number, use the Math Object Methods of min and max
you will present the results of these calculations in the text area - DO NOT USE ALERT BOXES!!!
your script should not present any result if the user does not type NUMBERS in the input boxes and, instead, you should present an error message in the textarea

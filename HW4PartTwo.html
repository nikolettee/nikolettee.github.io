<p style="font-size: 25px"><strong>Compound Interest</strong></p>
<p>See how your account balances can grow with this interest type.</p><br>


<br><h3>What is compound interest? </h3>

<p> The definition of compound interest is basic: the interest that is earned on both the original financial amount and on the interest that is accumulating. Compound interest allows someone's savings to grow faster over time. </p>

<p>Accounts that use compound interest, such as a standard savings account, the return gets added to the original principal at the end of every compounding period, typically daily or monthly. Each time interest is calculated and added to the account, the result in a larger balance. With the compound interest formula, the account earns more interest in the next compounding period.
</p>

<br><h3> How Compound Interest Works </h3><br>

<img src="https://www.codespeedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/compound-interest-formula-diagram-1024x537.png" alt="compound interest" width="350" height="250"><br><br>


<p>
The formula to calculate the compound interest can also be seen as A = P(1 + r)n.
<br>P is the principal (the initial amount borrowed or deposited).
<br>r is the annual rate of interest (percentage).
<br>n is the number of years the amount is deposited.
<br>A is the financial amount accumulated after n years, including interest.
</p>


<br><h3>Examples</h3>
<p> Three tables with the calculation of compound interest on a principal of $1000.<br>Each of the tables will show the rows from year 1 through 5.
<br>

<br>The first table will be for the interest rate of 5%.
<br>The second table will be for the interest rate of 6%.
<br>The third table will be for the interest rate of 7%.
</p>

<br><h4>Example One</h4>

<script >
var amount = 1000; 
var rate = 0.05;
var year= 5;
var yearlyInterestPaid; 
var totalAmount = amount;

 document.writeln( "<table>" ); 
 document.writeln( "<tr>" );
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Year" +"</th>");
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Amount on Deposit" +"</th>");
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Interest Rate" +"</th>");
document.writeln( "<tr>" );


 for ( var i = 1; i <= year; i++ ) {  				<!-- rows -->
 document.writeln( "<tr>" );
   yearlyInterestPaid = totalAmount* rate;
    totalAmount += yearlyInterestPaid;

document.writeln( "<td>" + i +"</td>" ); 
document.writeln( "<td>" + totalAmount.toFixed(2) +"</td>"  );
 document.writeln("<td>" + rate +"</td>");

document.writeln( "</tr>" );  } 
 document.writeln( "</table>" );
 
</script>


<br><br><h4>Example Two</h4>


<script >
var amount = 1000; 
var rate = 0.06;
var year= 5;
var yearlyInterestPaid; 
var totalAmount = amount;

 document.writeln( "<table>" );
 document.writeln( "<tr>" );
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Year" +"</th>");
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Amount on Deposit" +"</th>");
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Interest Rate" +"</th>");
document.writeln( "<tr>" );

 for ( var i = 1; i <= year; i++ ) {  				<!-- rows -->
 document.writeln( "<tr>" );
   yearlyInterestPaid = totalAmount* rate;
    totalAmount += yearlyInterestPaid;

document.writeln( "<td>" + i +"</td>" ); 
document.writeln( "<td>" + totalAmount.toFixed(2) +"</td>"  );
 document.writeln("<td>" + rate +"</td>");

document.writeln( "</tr>" );  } 
 document.writeln( "</table>" );
 </script>


<br><br><h4>Example Three</h4>

<script> 
var amount = 1000; 
var rate = 0.07;
var year= 5;
var yearlyInterestPaid; 
var totalAmount = amount;

 document.writeln( "<table>" );
 document.writeln( "<tr>" );
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Year" +"</th>");
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Amount on Deposit" +"</th>");
 document.writeln("<th>" + "Interest Rate" +"</th>");
document.writeln( "<tr>" );

 for ( var i = 1; i <= year; i++ ) {  				<!-- rows -->
 document.writeln( "<tr>" );
   yearlyInterestPaid = totalAmount* rate;
    totalAmount += yearlyInterestPaid;

document.writeln( "<td>" + i +"</td>" ); 
document.writeln( "<td>" + totalAmount.toFixed(2) +"</td>"  );
 document.writeln("<td>" + rate +"</td>");

document.writeln( "</tr>" );  } 
 document.writeln( "</table>" );

<h3> Pros and Cons of Compounding </h3>

<h4> Pros </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Can contribute to building wealth long-term in savings and investments</li>
  <li>Mitigates some wealth risks</li>
  <li>Compounding can work when making loan repayments</li>
</ul>
  

<h4> Cons </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Unfavorable for consumers making minimum payments on high-interest loans or credit card debts</li>
  <li>Returns are taxable</li>
  <li>Can be challenging to calculate</li>
</ul><br><br>


<h3> The Bottom Line </h3>
<p>Compound interest maintains a chance to take advantage of the time value of money. Compound interest on savings and investments has a long-term effect, as this type grows deposits faster than the simple interest route. Overall, when choosing an investment, consider both the the number of periods and the interest rate, where a modest rate-of-return can accumulate rewards overtime.</p>

<!--For Part 2: 

You will create a web page to show to interested clients how the compound interest works.

As soon as you open that web page on the browser to the client, it will have a heading such as "Learn about compound interest"

Below the heading you will code a script to show 3 tables with the calculation of compound interest on a principal of $1000.

The first table will be for the interest rate of 5%
The second table will be for the interest rate of 6%
The third table will be for the interest rate of 7%
Each of the tables will show the rows from year 1 through 5.

The formula to calculate the compound interest is: A = P(1 + r)n where:

P is the principal (the initial amount borrowed or deposited)
r is the annual rate of interest (percentage).
n is the number of years the amount is deposited.
A is the financial amount accumulated after n years, including interest.


The table will look like what is shown here below (the table below is showing only the first 4 years and for only the 5% interest rate):

The first column will have the number for the year
The second column will have the Amount calculated, based on that formula for that year
The third column will have the interest rate that is being used
Year	Amount on deposit	Interest Rate
1	1050.00				0.05
2	1102.50				0.05
3	1157.63				0.05
4	1215.51				0.05
There is NO INPUT for this problem! The 3 tables (one for 5%, another for 6% and another for 7%) should be shown as soon as the page is opened (loaded in the browser).


IMPORTANT TIP: The more efficient way to resolve this problem is to make one loop inside the other (nested loop). It is not ok if you set the 3 tables first and then loop to write only the results on the tables! Think about future maintenance - for example, if the company requests to show one more table for another interest rate, or if it is requested to present 10 years, instead of 5 for each interest rate. The less places you have to modify, the better your code is considered. So, use nested loop

MORE FOR THIS TIP: the outside loop should be for the interest rate that will start a new table tag and the top part of the table (table headings), then the internal loop should be for each year to build the rows of that table!

You should use jQuery or CSS to alternate the background colors of the rows - whatever colors you want - it does not need to follow the format shown here
TIP: If using CSS, you can think about nth-of-child pseudo-class for the tr tag!

<h2>Explanation of AJAX- the JS workings and AJAX calls</h2>
<p> A few functions are necessary for the functioning of "getting the CD collection." The javascript relation to the collection is that the supporting function titled myFunction(xml) has a xml file parameter. The contents will be read, through use of a loop, for the length of the file, starting at each new "CD" tag, printing the artist and title. </p>
<p>The main function loadDoc() connects to the user button and responds to the requests by redirecting to the myFunction(xml) for a user. The AJAX relation to the collection is that information is being read from a web server, after the web page has loaded. The loadDoc() is the primary example to this web development language. When the server response is ready, an HTML table will be formed and parts are displayed from the XML file. </p>

<h2> REST API</h2>

<h1>Title: Food API</h1>
<h2>Uncover over thousands of recipes and of food products.</h2><br><br>

</p><br>

<h4>While documentation is currently unavailable to provide, some useful features are: </h4>
<ol>
<li>Classify a grocery product</li>
<li>Match recipes to daily calories</li>
<li>Generate meal plan</li>
<li>Classify cuisine</li>
<li>Image analysis and classification</li>
<li>Visualize recipe nutrition, price breakdown, and equipment</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p> Overall, the variety of its beneficial features allows developers to create different kinds of nutrition and food apps.
